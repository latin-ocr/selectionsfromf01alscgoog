lo-le. sen et-et qula-tnm-vidobatun· This passage has
occaeiomd much dkctrnion. Some editors reject et before injuria,
some reject quin, others read et quin ior tum, end yet others have
quininbraokcte, ne if spurious. But ull these changes nre contrary ιο
the authority of the MSS, and besides ere nnneceesary und inadmis-
uble. 'l'he eense oi the passage seems ιο be this :-'i'he sons oi Ancus,
bent upon preventing by violent means, so toul a dishoner to tbe Ro-
man nume, and their own royul house, preferred to attaok anquin
himself, rather than Servius⁴ And lor tlrree musone: first, irum a

survived, would be a severer avenger of the murder tbnn a private

successor to the throne. 'l'be first 'two clauses ure ench introduced by

to go beyond the usage oi the writer, and explain why he omits the
particle, and gives the bnre thought by itseli, we may perhaps find a
reason in the sect, that the logical relation oi thelolnuse to tbe other
perte oi the sentence sufficiently lines its causal character, without the
insertion oi u causei particle. Finelly, the lest cletus adds a third
τοιοοο, end is introduced by tum, which is equivaleut ιο tum etiam, or
pretereo. For tbe force oi tum, see Hand, Tors 2, pp. 5³7, 8, where
