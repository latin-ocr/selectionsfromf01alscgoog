MSS. Alschefski compares ‘Livy 30, 57, and Tac. Anu. 6, 17.

‘⁶ cloacamque maximam. The construction ol this grem
seweris commonly escrilred to Tarquinius Priscus, and was certainly
commenoed byhim. See Livy, c. 38. It is still visible at hmo, a
massiva monument of the greatness of Rome in the regal period. It
was formed ot three tiers of ⁴arches, one within the other, the inner-
most ol which is a semicircular ruult, of eighteen Roman palme, about
iourtcen ieet in diameter. The arches are formed of immense hlocks,
more than five teet in length, and nearly three in thickness See

10. Utin ea regione, etc. Ut may be transleted ‘⁴ tor,” “tor
that region, &c.’' The construction iselliptical, and may be explained
by supplying aiter ut, e. g, the words fieri petua, as was possible.
Compare Livy, 2, 50, ex opulentissima, ut ‘tum res aaut, Etrusca
civitate. Ano 10, 46, in insigni, ut illerum temporum habitus, erat
triumpho; end many other passages. So eleo, Cic. Brutus 10, 39, hi,
ut populi Rauraci utar eet, sones. These passages sufficiently explain
the ellipsis in the present passage, and also in Livy 21, 34; 30, 33;
and Cic.deOrat'3,18; De Senectute, 4, 12 ; Brut 10, 41; and all
