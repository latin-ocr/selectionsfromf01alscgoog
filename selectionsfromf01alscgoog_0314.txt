ὕψου major emet, quam ut juvenum promissis tidem habere posset, Cem- γ

of bis advisere was net a sufficient warrent for the thing itself.”

155 θ. Ab Latino nombre· Thisis Alschefski's emendation of the MS
reading, ab Latinorum nominum ,· “ but the Punic, differing from the
latin name,'' dec.

11. Ubl terrarum esset, “whe're in the world he was.” See Ζ.
§4343 hand S.§212, Remi, N. 2.

20. Nee abnuebant-parere. abnuebant tobe joined with puio,
like the preceding verh The intervening clause quod-est belongs to

32. Ad rem fruendam, etc. Ad Alschefski reads from the MSS

instead of the conjecture of Gronovius, ut. Ad rem fr. must be joined
with venimus, and spectatarum with cedes ct incendia. “Have we
como hither to a spectacla, on which our oyes may feast, to gaze upon
the slaughter of our allice and the buming of their territory ‘t”

borch has shown from numerous instences.

Schmitz, Hist. c 12. -

22. Modo 0.· Lutatio, etc 'I'he allusion is to the nevel victory
of C. Lutatius Catulus, a. c. 242, in the first Punic war. See Schmin,
plati. Mede, like nuper, letely, is used in reference to intervals of
considerable length—here to ene of 25 years-when from any circnm-
