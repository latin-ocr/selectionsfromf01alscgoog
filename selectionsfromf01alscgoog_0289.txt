16, 17. catenen-ulteriorem ia reference to the position ”
‚ of the Carthaginiens.

18. nt eorum ipsorum, quoa Eorum ipe. refers to the Voles),
and the genitive depende upon quoe. As if it were written thus:
(the relative preceding the demonstrative, as often in Livy,) et quos
eornm (sc. Volcamm) sedes, etc, “and also these of (the Volcae)
themselves, whom,'’ &c

19. Slmnl pellicit-simul et ipsi-ouptehant. The clames

pact an arrangement like this: Ceteri aeccle-epecram-simnl oh

3. Prodito fumo, “by raising a smoka.'’ Alschefski jains pro-114
dite with loeo, taking prodito in the sensa of edito ,· but he gives no

θ. Equites fere propter equos, cto Agnae is the subject cf
the sentence3 equites is govemed by transmittens, and nantes agrees
with equos. Propter means “near,’', Z. p 302. 'l'he erdcr is as fol·
lows: Navium agmen equites ad excipiendum adversi fluminis impe·
tum parte superiore, fere pmpter nantes equos transmittens tranq.—
praebebat-The naves, vessels of the largest sire, were used for the

· cavalry, and the tmall bocts, lintres, fer the infantry. Alschefski
reads eques, etc, bnt, as it seems to me, fails te establish bie view of
the meaning ol the paoeage. Dr. Amold thus describes the arrange-
ment: “The heaviest vessels were placed on tho left, highest up
the stream, to form something of a breakwater for the smaller craft
momiug belew: the small boats held the flower ol the light-armed feet,
while the cavalry were in the larger vessels'’-Hist. Rome, 11. p. 280.
