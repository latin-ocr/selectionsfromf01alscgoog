Cu. xli-ao. Quo diem, etc 1 prefer this reading, with Fabri
aud Bokker, and Alschefski ιιι the smaller edition, though it has the
authority of but a single manuscript. Quo refers ιο Tibur, aud the
whole expremion is in exact accordance with tlte words just above in ,

44. Vtetos tandem suos Μαι-ιιοι, οιο. This conjecturat reading
Alschefski adopted iu his smaller edition; aud it seems ιο ιιιο prefer-
able to any that has been suggested. Romanis has, in translation, the.

, force of the genitive, aud we may translate thus: “ that the Romam
too had at last lost their martial spirit” Martios, i e. the spirit which
they bolleved that they inheritsd from Mars himself Alschefski, in
the largsr edition, reads querularum, etc, from the MSS, and trans·
lates thus: gesunken sei eudlich den Romem ilrr eiust wie Kampflus-
tiger Sinn; but thwe words, though sufficiently clear of themselves,
seem ιο ιιιο by no means a legitimate translation of the naen, and do
not relieve the tls. reading quoe of ils difficulty.

ed by Fabii aud Bekker, and by Alschefski in the smaller edition. Iu
the larger, Ahohcfski bes incensas, the reading ol some lator Mss.;
but, as Fabri hu observed, ιἰιειιιειιο does ιιοι seem suited at all ιο
Hanmbal’s present state of mind3 aud besides, the construction itself
animum incensus, the Greek acc, seldom occurs in Livy.

14. illst-necessario cogeret· Iu the larger edition, Alschefski
bas ιιοιειοιιιίἰ, (genitive,) according to one MS. cogeret may be
taken absolutely, ‘⁶ required ;” or we may easily supply egredi οι mi-
