followed the route as originally made out by General Meluille, the cor·
rachese of which cannot be doubted. Gen Helville's account oi the
march 'ei Hannibal may be found in Μ. de Luc's Hictoirc do Poecage
dea Alpes por Hannibal, Geneve et Paris, 18183 aad in Wickham aad

It may be well‘to give here a brief statement ol Hannibale route
Alter opossing the Pyrenaea, he went toNimea. From Nimee 'aa marched
to the Rhene, which he erossed at Roqnemaure, end then went ap the
river to Vienna. From thence, he marohed acro· the ilnt country ol
Dauphin6‚ aad rejoined the Rhene et St. Genie d’Aemte. He then
erossed the Mont du Chat to Chambery, joined the lsere at Hontmeillan,
moended it asser as scer, crossetl the Iaittle St Bernard, and descended
upon Aeeta and Ivreaby the river Doria Baltea. Alter halting aahort
time at Ivrea, he marched upon Turia, which he took. aad then prepared
himself ior operatione against the Romans.

Ι adelhere Dr. Amcld's vrew ci Hannibal's route :-

“ Oa the whole‚iit appears to me meetprobable‚ mat the pass by which
Hannibal entered Italy, was that which was known to the Romans by
the name ci the Graian Alps, and to ns ae the Little St. Bernarth Nor
was this ec circuitous a line ee we may at first imagine. For Hannibale
object was not simply to get into Italy, bat to arrivs in the counoy oi
those Cisalpine Gauls with whom he had been corresponding. Now these
were the Boii and Insubrians3 and as the Insubrium, who were the more

. westerly oi the two, lived between the Adai aad the Ticinus, the pass ol
the Little St Bernard led mora directly into tha country os his allice, than

the shorter passage into Italy by the Cottian Alps, or Mont Genewre.”-
