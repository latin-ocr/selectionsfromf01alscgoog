deemed inexpedient to increase unnecessarily the size
of the volume.

The text is chiefly that of Alschefski3 whose excel·
'lent edition* not yet completed, is understood to mark
a new era in the history of the text of Livy, and, iu the
judgment of distinguished European scholars, will un-
questionably attain and long hold the rank of the stand·
ard critical edition of Livy. Wherever other readings
have been preferred to those of Alschefski, the reasons
for the preference are usually given in the Notes.

The Notas have been prepared with chief reference
‘ to the grammatical study of the language; to the illus·
tration of its forms, construetions, idioms, of its usages
in general, and in particular, of the usage of Livy·
Wherever it was possible, it has been thought best, sim·
ply to furnish apt references to such grammars and
auxiliary works as were supposed to be in the hands of
the student; hut important difficulties, which required
m'ore ample means of investigation and study, have been
more fully discussed and explained. It is hoped that
the Notes will be also found to embrace all necessary
information relating to history, geography, and antiqui
ties, together with useful references to such standard
works as are accessible to the student. A list of such
worhs as are commonly referred to, may be found
on the page immediately preceding tha Notes. It has
