6. nantum-creverant-'ut-auu alut· It will be seen thet the
perf. subj. susi sint is used, where according ιο tho mle for the suc·
cessioh of tenses, we should expect the huperf. auderent. For this
general rulo for the tenses, see A. and 88 2583 Μ 516; Aru. Pr.
lntr. P. Ι. p 29. On the nse of the perf. subj. in this instance aud in
others, seerh and S. q 258, tte ; Z. 3504, Νοιο ; Aru. Pr Intr. P Ι.

as a peculiarity of Nepos3 especially Zumpt, and Haase, iu Reisig’s
Vorlesgg. Anm. 480. Βιιι we meet with the same construction
frequently in Iivy3 and instanoes are not wanting in Tacitus aud
Suetonius, aud also in Cicero. Zumpt speaks of the instances in Livy,
as ocourring “ only now and then, and more for the sake of variety,
thau on any definite principle ;” a mode of dispcsing of the subject,
which seems hardly satisfactory. In addition ιο the explanatione fur·
nished by the authors above referred to, to which 1 here add, (Madvig,
Lat. Sprachl.q ³82, Anna 1,) 1 venture to propose, as applicabis to
the present passage, aud to many others, in which a perf. suhj, iu a
clause deuotiug a consequence, follows a past tense, the following rulo:
The imperf. subj. is used, when the writer proceeds, iu the historical
order, from the cause ιο the consequence, and wishes to represent the
latter as resulting from the former. The perf. snbj.is used, when, οιι
the conuery, the writer argues from the emesequence back ιο the
cause, aud Υιιιοιιιιι the latter, in order to determine and establish the

former. (See Archiv.f1”rr Phil. Bd. 1, p. 78.) Το illustrate in the
present menneo: Livy does not intend ιο represent, historically, the
fact of no one dariug ιο attempt hqstihties against the Latius, as a
consequence of the increase of their power, but rather ιο stete thet

fact, in order to malie clear ιο his readers, how greatly that power had
increased ; in other words, he does not develop, historicslly, the cou-
sequence out of the cause, but rather, speculatinely, establishes the
carne, hy stating the consequence Hence tlte perf. 'Ihe idea of the
sentence might otherwise thus be expressed: Quantum opes crevissent
-ex eo potest intelligi—quod-ousi stent. Ou the other haud, iu the
very next sentence, Livy uses the hnperf. esset, because hethere
wishes to represent historically, the esttlement of the boundary, as
the consequence of the peace, which hod been agreed upon. Other
instanees in Livy, of the perf. subj. after ut, in clauses expressing u
consequence, (some of which we shall have occasion lrereafter to uo·
tice,) are the following: 2, 20, ut-occt'deritt 3, 3, est-pertulerint,
rh 29, ut-decreoerit‚· 5, 43, ut-tentoeerint ,· ib. 45, ut-hnbuerint,
