³9. Donec—interiit. Livy mentions this circumstance more at
length in a 9, cap. 29, 34. The censor Appius Claudius prevailed
npon tho Potitii to delegate the priestly office to public slaves, at the
nme time qualifying them, by instruction, for the performence of ita
duties. For this profanation they were believed to have been visited

lly Ca. vnn-a, lta-si. Ito means ‘⁴ eo modo‚” ln tter nuncet,
thoe. It has frequently tha force of co conditione, and especially
when joined as here with ci,· ito-si meaning on condition thot, =
only—is, not-unless. Thus, in the sentence quc-sore rotas, ai,
“thinking that there would not be, dac, eahae, doc.” The construo·
tiou cic—oi isa similar one, cic meaning ‘⁶ hoc modo” See Hand's
'rna ΙΙΙ. pp. 467 seqq, and Arra Pr. Intr- P. Ι. 451, and P. IL (Eng.
ed.) 777.
‚ 4. cum-turn, “ not only, but also,” the second being the more hn-
portant notion. Hence tum is frequently strengthened by menime, as
here, or by certe, precipue, doc. Z. b 723. The construction com-

le. Qui nunc-est, “where is now tha enclosure, ou the de-
scent (from the Capitol) between the Two Groves.” This place fixed
upon for the Asylum, here called Inter Duos Lucos, was the valley
between the two sammits of the Capitoline hill—the northeastern, on

. which now stands the Church of S. Maria in Araceli, (see Plan of ,
Rome.) and the southwestem, on which stands the Caffarelli Palaoe
Becker’s Handbuch d. Rom. Alterth. p. 385. Cicero refers to the placa,
in Epist adstat. 33 assequitur inter Doce Lucos hominem Milo.
