’1. Qum fama-excivisset· Alschefski has quo sorno, which
Drakenborch also pronounced the only true reading. The construction
certainly is peculiar, but yet the meaning intelligible. Fumo is tho
subject of eroioimt, and may be so translated3 or by supplying alter

in the Diot of Antiquities3 and to that article I refer the student for a
minute and aestuate view os the year of Numa, together with au ex·
