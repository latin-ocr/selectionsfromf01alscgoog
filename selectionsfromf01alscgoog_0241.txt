, ²¹1·
might well be expected hom the lact stated in the sentence imme-35
diately preceding, thet all the attendants had fled. Weissenborn
(Jahn's J ahrbtlcher, vol. 35, p. 387) conjectures sine omni, obserring
at the same time that such an expression is one of rare occurrence.
30—32· A quo-ad summum Ο. vicum, ‘⁶ when, ou being
ordered by him ιο retire from so great a tumult, she was on her way
home, and had reached the top of the Cyprian street” A Vicus was
adivision ol the city, consisting of a main street and several smaller
by-streets. Thus the full meaning here is, tle top os the moin street
os tlte Cyprios qnorter. See Dice Antiqq. (Vicus).
32. Flectuntt, etc-ostendit· Flectenti=“cum flecteret, ie.

flecti ad dextram carpentum juberet θ’ aud the passage may be trans-
lated thus: ‘¹ the person, who drove the horses, struck with horror,
stopped und drew iu the rains, and pointed eut to his mistress, who was
turning the charietto the riglpt towards the Urbian hill, {n order to ride

up to the Esquiline, the body of the murdered Servius lying upon the .
ground.'’ Yet a construction, so unusual, must ever leave iu some un-
certainty the reading flectenti, notwithstanding the uniforrn testimony
ot the best MSS. Gronovius conjectured the nominative flectens, agree-
ing with is, ο reading, however, which is far from rolleving the nas·
, sege ol its difficulty.
