9 Cn. vb-r. Numitor inter primum, etc. 'l'his sentence well
dluetrates the sacility with which the Latin language expresses a great
variety oi collaterol circumstances in oue sentence, without iujury to
the unity aud perspicuity of the sentence, aud even to their direct ad·
vantage Hero Numitor ostendit 'ar the principal clause; all tho ¹
othere are subordinate, aud depend upon the one principal clause, with
the utmost order and distinctneoe. 'I'he sentence illustratas the several
constructione, hy means oi which such e period isformed, via, hythe
use ol the part agreeing with the subjectos the principal clause, dicti· “ l
tane, hy the abl. alra, perpetrata cade, aduocata coneilio, and by
conjunctione, cam—aoccaaact, postquam-uidit. In translation, the

whether introduced by the relative or a causal conjunctiora, which ex-
